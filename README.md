# **testframework**

## For build and run tests you need to do next step:
 1. Open your command line or Terminal application and enter the directory where you would like to copy the repository. For example:
 `cd ~/`
 2. Clone the repository by replacing <URL> with clone URL you copied in the previous step. The repository will be cloned into a new directory in this location.
 `git clone <URL>`
 3. Navigate into the directory of the repository you just created. Replace with your own repository's name.
 `cd <REPOSITORY-NAME>`
 4. Then type:
 `mvn clean install test`
